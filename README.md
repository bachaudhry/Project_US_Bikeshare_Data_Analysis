# Udacity Project - US Bikeshare Data Analysis

1. This script was written for **Project 2 (Term 1 - 2018) of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND)** and is used to explore the data generated by bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

2. The project was completed using JetBrains PyCharm Professional 2018.1 for Windows 10 Home. The datasets were accessed directly from PyCharm's integrated file explorer.

3. Data is imported from .csv files, which were provided by Udacity, with the data already being wrangled and cleaned for the purposes of statistical analysis. 

4. This script allows the user to enter raw input into the terminal to create an interactive experience while presenting the statistical analysis.

5. The datasets were provided by Motivate, which is a bike sharing system provider for many cities in the continental United States. The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:

     a. Start Time
     b. End Time
     c. Trip Duration (in seconds)
     d. Start Station
     e. End Station
     f. User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

6. The Chicago and New York City files also contain columns for:

     a. Gender
     b. Birth Year

7. Questions asked: As highlighted in the project, the script answers the following questions about the bike share data:

     a. What is the most popular month for start time?
     b. What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
     c. What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
     d. What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
     e. What is the most common start station and end station combination?
     f.  Which trip is the longest in duration?
     g. Which trip is the shortest in duration?
     h. What are the counts of different user types?
     i.  What are the counts of gender?
     j.  What is the earliest, latest and most common birth year?
